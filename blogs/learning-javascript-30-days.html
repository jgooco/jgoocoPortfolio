                <a href="https://jgooco.com//blogs/my-biggest-regret-as-a-computer-engineering-graduate" class="blog-links" target="_blank">Last blog post</a>, I talked about starting to add more skills in a practical manner, and I was deciding at the time to either start with Python or JavaScript. 
                Both languages are “easy” to learn, and with someone like me who already has programming experience in languages some would deem harder to learn, e.g. C++.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, as you can see by the title of this blog post, I have decided to learn JavaScript. In fact, I am not just going to learn JavaScript. 
                I am going to learn this programming language in 30 days! Will I be able to?                 
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, before we get into that, let me answer some questions you may be having, such as: 
            </p>
            <p>
                <em><strong>Why did I pick JavaScript over Python to learn first? 
                    Is JavaScript viable to learn in 2022? Can someone really learn JavaScript in just 30 days?</strong></em> 
            </p>
            <p>
                Read along to find these answers and more.

            </h2>            
            <p>
                There is no wrong answer in picking between two of the most popular and fastest-growing programming languages in the world. 
                So, to explain why I will be learning JavaScript over Python first, we should go over each language and explain the differences between the two languages.

                Python
            </h3>            
            
            <p>
                <strong>Python</strong> is a high-level, interpreted general purpose programming language, that is dynamically-types and gargbage-collected. 
                Python can be used for both developing complex and simple programs, while also serving as a scripting language to aid in building web applications. 
                Python is known as  a “batteries included programming language”, because of its vast range of libraries. Python was designed for easy readability.                 
            </p>
            <p>Here is a simple Hello World program written in Python:</p>

            <div class="pre-container">
                <pre tabindex = "0" style = "color:whitesmoke; tab-size: 4; background-color: rgb(0, 1, 55);" class="language-python">
                    <code class="language-python">
<span class="comment">#this program prints Hello World in Python</span> 
<span class="keyword">print</span><span class="punctuation">(</span>"Hello World"<span class="punctuation">)</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                Python also supports different programming paradigms, which are, Functional, Imperative, Object-oriented, and Procedural.
            </p>

            <figure class="size-1">
                <img src="/images/JavaScript-logo.png" alt="Python Logo" srcset="" style="width: 30%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            </figure>
            <h3 class="sub-points-header-3">
                JavaScript
            </h3>
            <p>
                <strong>JavaScript</strong>, or <strong>JS</strong>, is an object-oriented programming language standardized in the ECMAScript language specification
                 that is usually used to help create dynamic web pages. A
                 long with HTML and CSS,, the three make of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, 
                 in which JS provides dynamic functionality that HTML and CSS cannot do alone. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While JS is typically meant to be used for front-end development, JS can now also be used to program the backend, 
                which means JS can be used to perform full-stack, with code programmed for both the client and server side of code. 
                JS also supports multiple programming paradigms, which are Object-oriented, Functional, and Imperative. 
            </p>
            <p>Now, here is the JavaScript version of the Hello World program:</p>
            <div class="pre-container">
                <pre tabindex = "0" style = "color:whitesmoke; tab-size: 4; background-color: rgb(0, 1, 55);" class="language-js">
                    <code class="language-js">
<span class="comment">//this program prints Hello World in JavaScript</span> 
<span class="keyword">console</span><span class="punctuation">.</span><span class="function">log</span><span class="punctuation">(</span>"Hello World"<span class="punctuation">)</span><span class="punctuation">;</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
            <figure class="size-1">
                <img src="/images/PythonvsJS.png" alt="Python Logo" srcset="" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

            <h3 class="sub-points-header-3">
                Python vs JavaScript
            </h3>
            <p>While both Python and JavaScript are programming languages, they both have many differences. For instance, JavaScript support asynchronous programming,
                in which code can run seperately/parallel to the primary application thread. Python does not support asynchronous programming, but it does support tools
                that do support it. This way, while JavaScript may be better at larger scales, Instagram and YouTube are examples that show Python can be used for scale as well.
            </p>
            
            <p>Here is a table of more differences between the two programming languages:</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Python</th>
                    <th>JavaScript</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Idents define code blocks and new lines end statements</td>
                    <td>Curly braces define code blocks and semicolons terminate statements</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>No built in support for arrays</td>
                    <td>Built in support for arrays</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Supports built in hash tables</td>
                    <td>Has maps and sets</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>No implicit data type conversion</td>
                    <td>Has implicit data type conversion</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Class-based inheritance</td>
                    <td>Prototype-based inheritence</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Comprehensive standard libraries</td>
                    <td>Has fewer libraries</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Uses 'self' keyword for objects</td>
                    <td>Uses 'this' method for objects</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Exception raised when function is called with wrong parameters</td>
                    <td>Missing parameters assigned undefined value</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                <strong>With some of those differences in mind, in what cases would you typically use each language?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Python is also mainly a backend language, so it is typically restricted to the server side, while JavaScript can be both a front-end and a backend language.
                And while both can be used in web development, Python is also able to do more in other fields such as Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI.
            </p>
            <p>
                I must also point out, that one can build nearly any project with any programming language with enough knowledge, experience, and tools.
                It's just that some programming languages perform better at building certain applications than others. 
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                For my interests, I will be picking up JavaScript first, as I want to build up my skills as a Front-End developer first. 
                However, I do plan on eventually getting back to Python, as I am interested in its many uses as well. 
                For you, if you rather go into data science, machine learning, or even Back End work, Python may be the way to go. 
                But for me, I will be learning JavaScript.

                Is JavaScript still worth learning in 2022?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Now, you may wonder if JavaScript is still something worth learning in 2022. And, it is my belief that, yes it is, as the JavaScript 
                is currently the most popular language right now. Aaron Jack of the Aaron Jack | Freenote YouTube channel has a great video going 
                into what statistically are the top 5 most programming languages to get a job. I suggest you check it out for further analysis into his process:

                In the video, Aaron creates an equation, where Freelance work, job postings, and the Stack Overflow developer survey are weighted to give a final score, 
                and JavaScript came out on top as the most popular language.
            </p>
            <p>
                With 67.9%(link to Stack Developer survey) of developers using it at their job compared to 43.51% who use Python at work, 
                the job market for JavaScript is bigger now than ever in 2022, and with no signs of slowing down, 
                this is another reason I am learning JavaScript this year.

                Can I Really Learn JavaScript in 30 Days?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The answer to this question is yes… and no. You see, the plan IS to learn JavaScript in 30 days, but whether I learn it in less or more overall days is to be seen. 
                The reason behind this vague answer is thatI will be taking on the challenge that is aptly named 
                <a href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript" class="blog-links" target="_blank">“30 Days of JavaScript”</a>.

            <p>
                This is a GitHub repo by Asabeneh S. Yetayeh, in which both beginners and advances developers are challenged to learn JavaScript in just 30 days.
                Though, as Asabeneh has also stated:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote blockquote--bordered blockquote--quoted">
                <p class="blockquote-text">
                    30 days of JavaScript programming challenge is a step-by-step guide to learn JavaScript programming language in 30 days. 
                    This challenge may take more than 100 days, please just follow your own pace.

                </p>                
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
                The great thing about 30 Days of JavaScript is that the challenge will suit both beginners(myself) and advanced developers 
                who might want to brush up on skills and test themselves with the final projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project has also been translated into various other languages, such as Spanish, Korean, Vietnamese, and Polish to name a few. 
                This way, programmers internationally can begin their JavaScript journeys, lowering the bar on entry for this course.
            </p>
            <p>
                Asabeneh also has two other 30 Day challenges, with both 
                <a href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python" class="blog-links" target="_blank">Python</a> and 
                <a href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-React" class="blog-links" target="_blank">React</a>, with more on the way. 
                I look forward to possible tackling both in the future once I finish this challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, in summary, yes I will be taking on the 30 Days of JavaScript challenge. 
                Whether it takes me exactly 30 days is yet to be determined, but I will complete this challenge. 
                I will be documenting my journey in this blog, trying to reteach what I learn, document my successes and my failures, and show my progress at my journey for Day 30.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also will be streaming each of the lessons on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4DSwB13gqtgi_TZTLpaMGg" class="blog-links" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. So if you want to see this JavaScript Journey to 30 live, you can go there, and I will be
                saving the VODs for documentation purposes as well.
