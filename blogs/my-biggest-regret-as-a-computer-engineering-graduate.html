                    I graduated nearly a year ago, but I am still on the job hunt. What is my biggest regret,
                    and what I am doing to solve it?
                </h3>

            <p>
                I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Engineering back in August of 2021. 
                Back then, I had just quit my job at a local sandwich shop and had begun my job hunt to become a Software Engineer. 
                I was confident and excited about where the road ahead would lead me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast forward just under a year later and… I am without a Software Engineering job, though, not without a lack of trying. 
                In fact, I have received quite a few interviews, 
                including getting to the final interview round at a 
                <strong><a class="blog-links" href="https://fortune.com/2021/10/29/faang-mamaa-jim-cramer-tech-facebook-meta/" target="_blank">MAMAA(formerly FAANG)</a></strong> company, 
                or whatever the acronym is nowadays. 
                However, as evident by the fact that I am not celebrating that I got the job, 
                I did not in fact pass that stage of the interview process for this particular company.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through all the interviews that I have experienced, I have learned many lessons along the way, which have also enlightened me to my biggest regret…
            </p>

                <img src="/images/regret.jpg" alt="regret spelled out" srcset="">

            <h2 class="main-points-header-2">
                <strong>I underestimated how personal projects could impact opportunities in finding a Software Engineering job.</strong>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Now, what do I mean by this? On my resume, I actually have some unique projects compared to some other right out of college CS, SE, or CE/CMPE graduates.
                I have worked on a <a class="blog-links" href="/Projects/Gantry.png" target="_blank">prototype device for my internship.</a> 
                I have worked on a <a href="https://github.com/jgooco/FreeRTOS-MP3-Project" class="blog-links" target="_blank">microcontroller board to create an MP3 player using FreeRTOS.</a> 
                But, in terms of the simple projects, I had neglected them. I had not built even a simple portfolio website. I had not worked on a mobile app.
                I haven’t even dared to touch on figuring out how to use a database. And why is that?
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, I, the naive college graduate that I am, believed the projects I had and the skills 
                I had gained through my various classes would be enough to land me the job of my dreams. 
                And well, it has not worked out the way I thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I said before, I have recieved interviews, and I have gone to the final rounds of a couple, so it’s not that I believe I won’t get a job someday soon. 
                It’s more that, because I didn’t dabble in doing more personal projects, I have limited my opportunities in what jobs I could apply for.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, many companies are looking for Front End, Back End, or Full Stack Engineers to work on their websites. 
                And, since I had not even learned HTML outside of a random class in middle school, I have thus avoided applying for such jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I took (and dropped) an elective course on creating mobile applications, as the class required that I needed a MacBook to code, and not having a MacBook, 
                I dropped the class after the first day. That soured me on wanting to create Andriod or IOS mobile apps, and thus, any job postings like Mobile Application Engineer, 
                I scrolled past.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, I caught Covid, right around the time I was waiting on the MAMAA company to get back to me on if I would move past the final interview round. 
                Staying in my room, I had much time to reflect on my journey nearly 1 year after graduating. 
                Being told I was not able to move on from that final round at this MAMAA company made me ponder my thoughts even more.
                 And I realized how much I have limited myself on what opportunities to pursue.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite being rejected in the final interview rounds for a MAMAA company, 
                it actually <strong>increased</strong> my confidence that I had what it takes to land a job sooner rather than later. 
                However, I have changed my mentality on limiting myself. I will no longer stay regretting not having more personal projects, or learning new skills. 
            </p>
            <h2 class="main-points-header-2">How you may ask?</h2>
            <p>Well, first, I created this website. This website will be used both as my Portfolio and my Blog. To code this website, 
            I had to learn <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em> to add structure and style to my website. <a class="blog-links" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BroCodez" target:"_blank">Bro Code</a> has some great tutorials on both, both videos clocking in at an hour long. 
            Bro Code teaches in a more practical manner, explaining languages in a easy to learn fashion, and I suggest if you are looking to wanting to make your own website, 
            Bro Code is your guy to learn from.
            </p>

            <p>
                While I have not fully learned JavaScript, I also added some scripts to my site. 
                You will find the carousel slider in the <a href="/index.html#project" class="blog-links">Projects</a> section 
                and the responsive nature of my navbar turning into a drop down hamburger menu at smaller widths.
            </p>
            <p>
                With these news skills, I have implemented my first portfolio website, and entered the realm of Front End, 
                though I still have ways to go before feeling confident on applying for Front End positions, 
                I feel I am on track on opening up those opportunities sooner rather than later.
            </p>

            <p>
                Second, I will continue to brush up on my coding interview skills. While I have gone to the final rounds of some opportunities, 
                I could of had more interview oppurtunities and possibly landed a job if I took the coding round of these technical interviews more seriously. 
                It’s not enough just to know Data Strucutures and Algorithms at a conceptual level, but to actually answer coding questions, while controvertial for some, 
                is at this point a necessary skill on its own to land a Software Engineering or Developer job. 
                I may write more on how I will improve on this aspect in another post, so stay tuned.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I will begin on teaching myself new skills. Now I know what some of you are thinking, that this could lead to tutorial hell. 
                And I am aware I may have to walk that fine line. However, I will try to go about this differently, and rather than just watching videos, 
                I will try to find ways to learn, whether the way I am learning implements projects that I can learn skills practically, 
                or I will try to use the skills I gain to make projects on my own, even if I may not be fully well versed yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some options I am looking at in this aspect are 
                <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/" target="_blank" class="blog-links">Automating The Boring Stuff With Python by Al Sweigart</a>, 
                or <a class="blog-links" href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript#numbers" target="_blank">30 Days of JavaScript from the GitHub repo by Asabeneh</a>. 
                Both seem like good starting points, as while I have written a few scripts in both languages, I am by no means an expert, 
                or even comfortable writing basic code with either. I also am thinking about possibly learning mobile development, though that may be for another time.
            </p>
            <p>
                No matter which I choose, I will make an effort to document my journey as I continue to build my skills in my blog. 
                I will give updates on what I am learning, posts trying to reteach what I have learned, and overall any updates regarding my pursuit of becoming a Software Engineer. 
            </p>
